How to show birthdays over multiples lines in test files

How to to use describe effectively?

If i now wanted to remove add and put birthday as initialized how would I go about my TDD, could i just remove the first test?

This would also mean updating all of my TDD's lots of hassle, how to minimise this? (better design at the start?)

added new mock methods, need to then update all previous tests to include these mock methods? (last_name)
