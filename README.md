```

## Techniques Used

This was mainly an exercise in Test Driven Development, so I've ensured that all main methods and classes are fully tested in the specifications in ./spec. Use the 'rspec' command to run these yourself.

I have also been learning encapsulation, so I've divided the app into a series of classes:

 - **Person** - the basic object for the exercise, containing variables for both name and date of birth.
 - **Directory** - a class to store Persons, with some higher level methods like #todays_birthdays to perform operations on the stored Persons.
 - **Birthday** - the main class for the end user, provides a way for the other classes to be interacted with through stdin/stdout.
